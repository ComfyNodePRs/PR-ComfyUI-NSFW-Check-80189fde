![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7467524f-06b7-403e-bd6c-6597034b82d0)

## Project Overview

This project is designed to detect whether images generated by ComfyUI are Not Safe For Work (NSFW). It uses a machine learning model to classify images as either safe or not safe for work and returns a confidence score for the NSFW classification.

Using the score, a user can add logical filters to their workflow.

A threshold of 0.95 works well for most cases.
